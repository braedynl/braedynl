### About 💬
I currently work as a teaching assistant for Michigan State University's CSE231 - Introduction to Programming course (Python) under the supervision of [Dr. Richard Enbody](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~enbody/) and [Dr. Imen Zaabar](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/zaabarim). I research media psychology with [Dr. David Ewoldsen](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/david-ewoldsen).

As a TA, I host weekly class meetings with 20 or so students, ranging from freshman to senior level. The course has some weekly lecture videos and readings, where I then supplement with my own "mini-lecture" and class exercise. Outside of class meetings, we monitor a forum to answer students questions as they complete their homework assignments — usually consisting of a weekly project and coding challenge. I've been working as a TA since the beginning of 2020. I do Fall, Spring and Summer semesters. It's far and away the greatest job I've had, I love talking with my students and helping them learn 😁

### Maintenance 🖥️

Project development is currently slow due to University work. [CSE231-GITHUB](https://github.com/braedynl/CSE231-GITHUB) is actively maintained during this time.
